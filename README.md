# Introduction

In-depth study of the PHP language repository, testing examples of each function of this object-oriented programming language from version 5 (currently 8.4).

PHP is interpreted; in other words, it is not compiled, except when using tools or extensions like Zend Opcache or HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine) run engines.

For english readers - Excuse me if some examples are in spanish and form my grammar errors in bouth languages xd

I humbly acknowledge that I am using ChatGPT to generate so much code on my own because it is a tool that allows me to study this language in great depth effectively.

My goal is to differentiate the various ways to achieve the same result, questioning which one is the most optimal.

## Native PHP vs PHP extensions/modules

My current php version is PHP 8.3.11, to know yours run:
php -v

To know wich modules are in your php installation run:
php -m
